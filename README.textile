h1. Yii DB Migrations

A database migrations engine for the Yii framework. It comes in the form of an
extension which can be dropped into any existing Yii framework application.

It relies on the database abstraction layer of the Yii framework to talk to the
database engine.

It's largely inspired on the migrations functionality of the Ruby on Rails
framework.

h2. Current limitations

Be aware that the current version is still very alpha.

There are only two database engines supported:
* MySQL
* SQLite

In the current version, it's only possible to migrate up, it cannot (yet) remove
already installed migrations.

h2. Installing the extension

h3. Putting the files in the right location

Installing the extension is quite easy. Once you downloaded the files from 
github, you need to put all the files in a folder called "yii-dbmigrations" and
put it in the <code>protected/extensions</code> folder from your project.

h3. Configuring the database connection

You need to make sure you configure database access properly in the 
configuration file of your project. As the console applications in the Yii
framework look at the <code>protected/config/console.php</code> file, you need
to make sure you configure the <code>db</code> settings under the
<code>components</code> key in the configuration array. For MySQL, the 
configuration will look as follows:

<pre>
'components' => array(
    'db'=>array(
        'class' => 'CDbConnection',
        'connectionString'=>'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=my_db',
        'charset' => 'UTF8',
        'username'=>'root',
        'password'=>'root',
    ),
),
</pre>

For SQLite, the configuration looks as follows:

<pre>
'components' => array(
    'db'=>array(
        'connectionString'=>'sqlite:'.dirname(__FILE__).'/../data/my_db.db',
    ),
),
</pre>

h3. Configuring the command map

To make the <code>yiic</code> tool know about the <code>migrate</code> command,
you need to add a <code>commandMap</code> key to the application configuration.

In there, you need to put the following configuration:

<pre>
'commandMap' => array(
    'migrate' => array(
        'class'=>'application.extensions.yii-dbmigrations.CDbMigrationCommand',
    ),
),
</pre>

h3. Testing your installation

To test if the installation was succesfull, you can run the yiic command and
should see the following output:

<pre>
Yii command runner (based on Yii v1.0.6)
Usage: protected/yiic <command-name> [parameters...]

The following commands are available:
 - migrate
 - message
 - shell
 - webapp

To see individual command help, use the following:
   protected/yiic help <command-name>
</pre>

It should mention that the <code>migrate</code> command is available.

h2. Creating migrations

You can create migrations by creating files in the 
<code>protected/migrations</code> folder. The file names for the migrations
should follow a specific naming convention:

<pre>
m20090614213453_MigrationName.php
</pre>

The migration file names always start with the letter m followed by 14 digit
timestamp and an underscore. After that, you can give a name to the migration so
that you can easily identify the migration.

In the migration file, you need to create a class that extends the parent class
<code>CDbMigration</code>. The <code>CDbMigration</code> class needs to have the
<code>up</code> and <code>down</code> methods as you can see in the following
sample migration:

<pre>
class m20090611153243_CreateTables extends CDbMigration {

    public function up() {

        $this->createTable(
            'posts',
            array(
                array('id', 'primary_key'),
                array('title', 'string'),
                array('body', 'text'),
            )
        );

        $this->addIndex(
            'posts', 'posts_title', array('title')
        );

    }

    public function down() {
        $this->removeTable('posts');
    }

}
</pre>

h2. Applying migrations

Once you created the migrations, you can apply them to your database by running
the <code>migrate</code> command:

<pre>
protected/yiic migrate
</pre>

You will see the following output:

<pre>
2009-06-14 21:42:04 Creating initial schema_version table
2009-06-14 21:42:04 Applying migration: m20090611153243_CreateTables
2009-06-14 21:42:04     >> Creating table: posts
2009-06-14 21:42:04     >> Adding index posts_title to table: posts
2009-06-14 21:42:04 Marking migration as applied: m20090611153243_CreateTables
2009-06-14 21:42:04 Applying migration: m20090612162832_CreateTags
2009-06-14 21:42:04     >> Creating table: tags
2009-06-14 21:42:04     >> Creating table: post_tags
2009-06-14 21:42:04     >> Adding index post_tags_post_tag to table: post_tags
2009-06-14 21:42:04 Marking migration as applied: m20090612162832_CreateTags
2009-06-14 21:42:04 Applying migration: m20090612163144_RenameTagsTable
2009-06-14 21:42:04     >> Renaming table: post_tags to: post_tags_link_table
2009-06-14 21:42:04 Marking migration as applied: m20090612163144_RenameTagsTable
</pre>

It will apply all the migrations found in the
<code>protected/migrations</code> directory provided they were not applied to
the database yet.

If you run the <code>migrate</code> command again, it will show that the
migrations were applied already:

<pre>
2009-06-14 21:44:09 Skipping applied migration: m20090611153243_CreateTables
2009-06-14 21:44:09 Skipping applied migration: m20090612162832_CreateTags
2009-06-14 21:44:09 Skipping applied migration: m20090612163144_RenameTagsTable
</pre>
